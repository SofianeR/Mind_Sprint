        Welcome to MIND SPRINT, where every stroke, color and shape builds your
        path to victory! Choose an object to use as a pawn to start the game. To
        start the game, each participant stands on the starting square.

        To advance, draw a card. Each card is made up of five different
        questions, so you can choose the question you want according to your
        level of knowledge. You'll have 30 seconds to answer. The cards cover
        four different themes: Artistic Movement, Brand Evolution, Different
        Artists, History of Design.

      <p>
        The higher the question you choose, the more points you'll earn. You
        advance in the game according to the points you earn for the question
        you answer. One point moves you forward one square, five points moves
        you forward five squares.
